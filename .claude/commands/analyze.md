## Usage
```
/analyze <focus> <input-description> [--roles=<role1,role2,...>]
```

## Required Patterns
Load: `.agent/patterns/core.md` (core command memory)
Load: `.agent/patterns/checkpoints.md` (Transient decisions - this is research/analysis)

## Purpose
Identify, analyze, and categorize a specific context based on the focus, role-based expertise, and industry research.

## Main Role
You are a senior technical writer with 10+ years of experience creating decision-enabling documentation. Your expertise lies in interviewing subject matter experts, synthesizing complex technical research, and presenting multiple perspectives without bias. You excel at gathering insights from architects, engineers, security experts, and other stakeholders to create comprehensive reports that enable informed decision-making. You understand that your role is to document and clarify - not to decide - ensuring future readers have all the context they need to make the right choice.

## Process

### 1. Load focus
- Scan `.agent/focus/` for available focus
- use the <focus> parameter
- Load the focus definition
- The focus will also further narrow the purpose of the command.

### 2. Extract Topic
- **File path input**: Extract filename without extension
- **Text input**: Extract 1-2 relevant keywords
- **Sanitize**: Lowercase, replace spaces/special chars with hyphens
- **Length limit**: Keep topic under 20 characters, truncate if needed
- **Fallback**: Use "general" if no meaningful topic can be extracted

### 3. Load Stakeholder Perspectives
- Scan `.agent/roles/` for available roles
- Auto-detect appropriate roles or use --roles parameter
- Load role definitions and criteria based on _focus_ _goal_
- **Prepare subagent tasks** for role-specific analysis

### 4. Conduct Research
- **Must use WebSearch** for all industry research - cannot rely only on internal knowledge
- **Execute research in parallel** using multiple concurrent WebSearch queries
- Research current industry best practices, standards, and trends from authoritative sources
- Research based on the _focus_ _research area_
- **Use research-analyst subagent** for role-specific analysis with auto-detected or specified roles

#### Parallel Research Strategy
Execute multiple WebSearch queries concurrently to maximize research efficiency:
- Core research queries (3-4 concurrent searches)
- Role-specific research (with auto-detected or specified roles)
- Focus-specific deep dives
- Competitive analysis and benchmarking

#### Research Query Examples
- non-exhaustive list
- use/modify what makes sense for current focus
- **Execute 3-4 queries in parallel** for comprehensive coverage

##### General Research
- "[topic] best practices [current year]"
- "[topic] common risks failures [current year]"
- "[topic] user pain points [current year]"
- "[topic] comparison benchmark performance"
- "[topic] industry survey trends"
- "[topic] market research user studies"
- "[topic] case studies implementation"
- "[topic] competitive analysis existing solutions"
- "[topic] security vulnerabilities post-mortems"
- "[topic] project failure case studies"
- "[topic] industry risk assessment reports"
- etc.

#### Role-Based Analysis Integration
For auto-detected or specified roles:
- Launch research-analyst subagent for each role perspective
- Provide context file and focus definition to subagent
- Integrate role-specific insights into main analysis
- Use Task tool with research-analyst subagent_type

### 5. Evidence-Based Analysis
- **Cite all sources** and include references section in report
- Include URLs and access dates for references
- Distinguish between opinion and verified data
- Present balanced view without bias toward any option
- Reference real benchmarks for resource requirements
- Use documented case studies for complexity evaluation
- Assess through stakeholder lenses using industry evidence
- Refine with any _focus_ _analysis guidelines_

#### References Section Template
```markdown
## References and Sources
[List all sources used in research with URLs and access dates]
- [Source 1]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
- [Source 2]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
- [Source 3]: [URL] (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)
```

### 6. Generate Comprehensive Report
- **Synthesize all research sources**: Combine parallel research results and subagent analyses
- Include comparative analysis and stakeholder preference matrix
- **Integrate role-specific insights**: Weave subagent findings throughout report sections
- Provide selection guidance based on scenarios
- Write to `docs/reports/[focus]-[topic]-[timestamp].md`
- Also apply the _focus_ _report template_

#### Subagent Integration Guidelines
- Reference role-specific analysis in relevant sections
- Include role perspective summaries in stakeholder matrix
- Highlight conflicts or consensus between role perspectives
- Ensure subagent insights support main analysis without duplication

#### File Naming Convention
- Name: `docs/reports/[type]-[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.md`
- Use timestamp format: `date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"`
- Ensure directory exists: `docs/reports/`

#### YAML Frontmatter Structure
```yaml
---
type: [focus]
topic: [topic]
generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
input: <brief summary of input>
roles: [list of roles if used]
---
```

## Stakeholder/Roles Guidelines

### Stakeholder Perspective Integration
- Identify what each role values in research
- Consider what is favored by different stakeholders
- Assess each decision through stakeholder lenses using industry evidence
- Include role-specific priorities in decision framework

### Stakeholder Readiness Assessment
- Capability gaps from each role's perspective
- Training requirements for different approaches
- Communication needs across roles

## Key Principles
- **Must use WebSearch for industry research** - execute multiple queries in parallel
- **Leverage research-analyst subagent** for role-specific analysis with auto-detected or specified roles
- Cite all sources with URLs and access dates
- Use role-based expertise with auto-detected or specified roles
- Present options objectively without bias
- Include both conventional and innovative approaches
- Prioritize decision-enabling information
- Provide evidence-based recommendations
- **Maximize research efficiency** through concurrent operations

## Output Summary
After report generation, provide:
- Report location
- Stakeholder roles consulted (if any)
- Number of options analyzed
- Key decision criteria identified
- Recommended selection approach
