name: sync-context
description: Extract and integrate critical information from any file into core project context files.
parameters:
  - name: any-file
    description: Path to file to sync or 'init' to initialize
---

## Usage
```
/{{name}} <any-file>
/{{name}} init
```

## Parameters
{{parameters}}

## Required Patterns
Load: `.agent/patterns/core.md` (core command memory)

## Purpose
{{description}}

## Main Role
You are a senior software producer with 10+ years of experience coordinating complex technical projects. Your expertise lies in identifying and preserving critical information that enables team continuity, preventing knowledge silos, and ensuring consistent technical approaches across project phases. You excel at recognizing which artifacts and decisions will impact future work and proactively capturing them in accessible formats.

## Content Classification and Analysis

### Automatic Classification Indicators

#### Decision Indicators
Words/phrases that signal decisions were made:
- "decided", "chose", "selected", "approach taken"
- "rationale", "because", "reason"
- "went with", "opted for", "strategy"

#### Lesson Indicators
Words/phrases that signal learnings:
- "learned", "discovered", "found that"
- "mistake", "issue", "problem"
- "insight", "research found", "investigation revealed"
- "turned out", "actually", "realized"

#### Architecture Indicators
Words/phrases that signal structural information:
- "component", "interface", "structure"
- "constraint", "requirement", "specification"
- "design", "pattern", "integration"
- "system", "service", "module"

#### Question Indicators
Words/phrases that signal open questions:
- "unclear", "need to research", "open question"
- "unresolved", "pending decision", "requires investigation"
- "need to determine", "TBD", "to be decided"
- "unknown", "depends on", "waiting for"

### Content Extraction Strategy

#### Smart Summarization
- Extract key points, not entire sections
- Focus on decisions and their rationale
- Capture context that explains why something matters
- Preserve technical details that affect future decisions

#### Source Traceability
- Always include reference to original file
- Note section/context where information was found
- Include timestamp if available
- Maintain chain of reasoning across files

## Process

### Regular Sync (any file)
1. **Analyze Content**: Use classification indicators to identify decisions, lessons, architecture, questions
2. **Extract Key Points**: Summarize rather than copy entire sections
3. **Integrate Smartly**: Add to appropriate target files with source references
4. **Flag Conflicts**: Only prompt when actual conflicts need resolution

### Initialization (`init`)
1. **Clean Setup**: Copy templates from `.agent/templates/project-init/`
2. **Remove SAID Meta**: Ensure no methodology content contaminates project context
3. **Ready State**: Leave placeholders for OVERVIEW.md and HIGH-LEVEL-DESIGN.md extraction

## Target File Mapping

### context/project-context.md
**Contains:** Vision, architecture, high-level constraints
**From source:** Architecture indicators, requirements, system design
**Integration:** Add to relevant sections, update architecture diagrams

### context/project/decisions-made.md
**Contains:** Key decisions with rationale and impact
**From source:** Decision indicators with reasoning
**Integration:** Chronological with source references

### context/project/lessons-learned.md
**Contains:** Research insights, mistakes, discoveries
**From source:** Lesson indicators, investigation results
**Integration:** Categorized by domain/topic area

### context/project/open-questions.md
**Contains:** Unresolved questions requiring investigation
**From source:** Question indicators, dependencies, unknowns
**Integration:** Prioritized by impact and urgency

## Integration Rules

### Preserve Existing Content
- Never overwrite without explicit conflicts
- Add new information to appropriate sections
- Maintain chronological order for decisions
- Keep cross-references intact

### Handle Conflicts
- Flag when new info contradicts existing
- Present both versions with sources
- Ask user to resolve only when necessary
- Default to more recent information when dates available

### Maintain Format Consistency
- Use standard headers and structure
- Include source references in consistent format
- Apply same categorization across files
- Keep summaries concise but complete

## Special Handling

### TODO Context Files
When syncing `todo-context.md`, extract from execution structure:
```
context/todo/{name}/execution/
├── decisions-made.md    → project/decisions-made.md
├── lessons-learned.md   → project/lessons-learned.md
├── open-questions.md    → project/open-questions.md
└── deliverables/        → Reference in project-context.md if architectural
```

## Key Principles
- Summarize, don't copy entire sections
- Always include source references
- Preserve existing content
- Apply classification patterns automatically
- Only ask user when conflicts require resolution

## Example Flow
```
User: /sync-context docs/reports/phase1-analysis.md

AI: Analyzing phase1-analysis.md for key information...

Found:
- 3 decisions (database choice, auth strategy, deployment approach)
- 2 lessons (performance bottleneck discovery, library compatibility issue)
- 1 open question (scaling strategy for year 2)

Integrating into:
- decisions-made.md: Added database and auth decisions with rationale
- lessons-learned.md: Added performance and compatibility insights
- open-questions.md: Added scaling question with context

All updates include source reference to phase1-analysis.md sections.
Context sync complete.
