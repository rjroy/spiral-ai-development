parameters:
  - name: context-file
    description: Context file to update
  - name: decision-report
    description: Source analysis report
  - name: selected-option
    description: Option chosen from the report

## Usage
```
/{{name}} <context-file> <decision-report> <selected-option>
```

## Parameters
{{parameters}}

## Required Patterns
Load: `.agent/patterns/core.md` (core command memory)

## Purpose
{{description}}

## Main Role
You are a senior software producer with 10+ years of experience managing technical decision-making processes. Your expertise lies in capturing not just what was decided, but why it was decided and what was rejected. You understand that well-documented decisions prevent team churn, enable onboarding, and provide crucial context when revisiting choices months later. You excel at preserving the full decision narrative - the constraints, trade-offs, and rationale that future teams will need.

## Process

### 1. Parse Decision Report
- Extract selected option details, rationale, alternatives
- Identify decision context and implementation requirements
- Validate option exists in source report

### 2. Handle Context File
- **Exists**: Load and parse structure
- **Missing**: Detect template pattern, create from template
- **Malformed**: Suggest validation/repair

### 3. Preview Integration
Show user:
- Selected option summary
- Where decision will be documented
- How it fits with existing context
- Any affected constraints or assumptions

### 4. Integrate Decision
- Add decision using standard format
- Update YAML frontmatter timestamp
- Preserve all existing context
- Maintain Markdown structure

## Decision Documentation Format

### Standard Decision Structure
```markdown
### Decision N: [Decision Title from Report]
**Selected Option**: [Chosen Option Name]
**Rationale**: [Why this option was selected]
**Alternatives Considered**: [Brief summary of other options]
**Implementation Requirements**: [Key requirements from selected option]
**Trade-offs Accepted**: [Acknowledged limitations/cons]
**Decision Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Source Analysis**: [Reference to options analysis report]

**Key Considerations:**
- [Important factor 1 from analysis]
- [Important factor 2 from analysis]
- [Important factor 3 from analysis]
```

### Integration by Context Type
- **Project Context**: Add to "## Key Decisions" section, update affected constraints/assumptions
- **Component/Feature Context**: Document in relevant technical section, update implementation requirements
- **TODO Context**: Document decision in task context, update completion status if blockers resolved

### Validation Checklist
- Selected option clearly identified in source report
- Decision rationale matches option analysis
- Implementation requirements captured
- Trade-offs and limitations documented
- Context file maintains proper Markdown structure
- Decision traceability is clear
- YAML frontmatter updated with timestamp
- No existing context lost or corrupted

## Template Detection and File Creation

### Template Selection Logic
- `component*.md` → `.agent/templates/component-artifact.md`
- `feature*.md` → `.agent/templates/feature-artifact.md`
- `implementation*.md` → `.agent/templates/implementation-artifact.md`
- `project-context.md` → `.agent/templates/project-context-init.md`
- Generic context files → `.agent/templates/project-context-init.md`

### File Creation Process
1. **Detect Template**: Match filename pattern to appropriate template
2. **Load Template**: Read template file from `.agent/templates/`
3. **Update Metadata**: Set YAML frontmatter (created_date, project_name, artifact_type, said_level)
4. **Replace Placeholders**: Substitute ProjectName, YYYY-MM-DD, ComponentName
5. **Create Structure**: Ensure directory structure exists (`context/` directory)
6. **Write File**: Create initial context file with template structure
7. **Proceed**: Continue with main operation on new file

### Fallback Structure (if template missing)
```markdown
---
project_name: "ProjectName"
created_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
artifact_type: "context"
---

# [Context Name]

## Overview
[Context description]

## Key Decisions
[Decisions made for this context]

## Implementation Notes
[Technical details and requirements]
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/sync-decision context/project-context.md options-analysis.md "Option 2"
```

### Component Decision
```
/sync-decision context/auth-component.md auth-options.md "JWT with refresh tokens"
```

## Key Principles
- Always preview integration before writing
- Preserve full decision rationale, not just choice
- Include alternatives considered for future reference
- Maintain traceability to source analysis
- Create files from templates when needed

## Example Flow
```
User: /sync-decision context/project-context.md arch-options.md "Microservices Architecture"

AI: Found "Microservices Architecture" in arch-options.md:
- Rationale: Better scalability and team autonomy
- Trade-offs: Increased complexity, network overhead
- Requirements: Container orchestration, service mesh

Context file exists. Will add to "Key Decisions" section.

Preview integration:
### Decision 3: System Architecture Approach
**Selected Option**: Microservices Architecture
**Rationale**: Better scalability and independent team development
**Alternatives Considered**: Monolith (simpler but scaling limits), Modular Monolith (middle ground)
**Trade-offs Accepted**: Increased operational complexity, network latency

Proceed with integration? (y/n)

User: y

AI: Decision integrated into context/project-context.md
Updated timestamp in YAML frontmatter
All existing context preserved
