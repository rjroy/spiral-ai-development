# SAID Subagent Integration Analysis

*Generated: 2025-01-04*

## Executive Summary

Analysis of how Claude Code subagents can enhance the Spiral AI Development (SAID) methodology through strategic integration with existing roles, experts, and commands. This document provides comprehensive recommendations based on research into subagent capabilities and the current SAID framework structure.

## Current SAID Architecture Analysis

### Existing Role System (.agent/roles/)
- **6 stakeholder roles**: business-analyst, client-architect, mobile-native-client-architect, operations-engineer, service-architect, solution-architect
- **Structured expertise**: Each role defines identity, expertise areas, risk categories, and early warning indicators
- **Integration pattern**: Used by `/analyze` command with `--roles` parameter for multi-perspective analysis
- **Auto-detection**: Commands can automatically detect relevant roles based on context keywords

### Existing Expert System (.agent/experts/)
- **5 domain experts**: crypto, pwa, rust, typescript, ux
- **Specialized knowledge**: Domain-specific principles, decision criteria, best practices, tools, and pitfalls
- **Integration pattern**: Used by `/work-on-todo` and `/decompose` commands with `--expert` parameter
- **Auto-detection**: Commands can detect need for expertise based on context analysis

### Current Command Structure (.claude/commands/)
- **9 core commands**: analyze, create-todo, create-todo-from-report, decompose, plan-next-steps, prime-context, sync-context, sync-decision, work-on-todo
- **Expert integration**: `/work-on-todo` and `/decompose` already load expert definitions
- **Role integration**: `/analyze` uses role-based perspectives for comprehensive analysis
- **Collaboration checkpoints**: Built-in human validation points for key decisions

## Subagent Integration Opportunities

### 1. Roles → Subagents Conversion

**Should we turn .agent/roles/ into subagents?**

**Recommendation: Hybrid Approach**
- **Keep roles as prompt-based expertise** for single-perspective analysis within commands
- **Create role-based subagents** for parallel multi-perspective analysis
- **New pattern**: `/multi-analyze` command that spawns parallel subagents for each relevant role

**Benefits:**
- Parallel processing of multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Independent analysis streams that can be synthesized
- Reduced context window usage per analysis stream
- Natural separation of concerns by stakeholder viewpoint

**Implementation:**
```
/multi-analyze problems "mobile app authentication" --roles=business-analyst,solution-architect,service-architect
→ Spawns 3 parallel subagents with role-specific prompts
→ Each analyzes from their perspective independently  
→ Main agent synthesizes results into comprehensive report
```

### 2. Experts → Subagents Conversion

**Should we turn .agent/experts/ into subagents?**

**Recommendation: Selective Conversion**
- **Keep experts as in-context expertise** for single-command tasks
- **Create expert subagents** for complex verification and specialized decomposition
- **New pattern**: Complex tasks automatically delegate to expert subagents for independent validation

**Benefits:**
- Independent verification of technical implementations
- Specialized decomposition for complex domains (e.g., cryptography, PWA architecture)
- Reduced main context pollution with domain-specific details
- Expert-level quality assurance without domain knowledge overhead

**Implementation:**
```
/work-on-todo context/todo/crypto-implementation.md
→ Detects cryptography requirements
→ Implements with base engineering approach
→ Spawns crypto expert subagent for independent security review
→ Returns implementation + expert verification report
```

### 3. Command Enhancement Opportunities

**Is there different subagents we could create to make .claude/commands/ behave better?**

**High-Impact Enhancements:**

#### A. Research Augmentation for `/analyze`
- **Research subagent**: Specialized for web search, source gathering, and evidence compilation
- **Benefits**: Parallel research while main agent structures analysis
- **Pattern**: Main agent defines research queries, subagent executes searches, returns structured findings

#### B. Verification Layer for `/work-on-todo`
- **QA subagent**: Independent implementation review using testing, security, and best practice lenses
- **Benefits**: Objective quality assessment without implementation bias
- **Pattern**: After implementation, QA subagent reviews with fresh context

#### C. Context Synthesis for `/decompose`
- **Synthesis subagent**: Specialized in combining multiple decomposition streams into coherent architecture
- **Benefits**: Better handling of complex multi-domain decomposition
- **Pattern**: Multiple domain-specific decomposition streams synthesized by specialist

#### D. Documentation Enhancement
- **Documentation subagent**: Specialized in creating comprehensive, user-focused documentation
- **Benefits**: Consistent documentation quality without interrupting main workflows
- **Pattern**: Triggered after implementation completion for documentation generation

### 4. Automation Guidelines

**Can we have some work on "auto"? And what would that be?**

**Automatic Subagent Triggers:**

#### Complexity Thresholds
- **Multi-domain requirements**: Automatically spawn domain expert subagents
- **Multi-stakeholder concerns**: Automatically engage relevant role subagents
- **Large decomposition scope**: Automatically parallel decomposition streams
- **Implementation verification**: Automatically trigger QA subagents for critical paths

#### Context Analysis Triggers
```
Input analysis → Automatic subagent selection
"authentication system with crypto" → crypto expert subagent
"mobile PWA with offline sync" → pwa + mobile expert subagents  
"enterprise deployment strategy" → operations + business analyst subagents
"user interface redesign" → ux expert + business analyst subagents
```

#### Quality Gates
- **Before major decisions**: Automatic stakeholder perspective analysis
- **After implementation**: Automatic expert domain verification
- **Before deliverable**: Automatic documentation generation and review

### 5. New Subagent Types

**Different subagents we could create:**

#### Specialized Coordination Subagents
- **Research Coordinator**: Manages parallel research streams for comprehensive analysis
- **Implementation Coordinator**: Manages parallel development streams for complex features
- **Verification Coordinator**: Manages parallel quality assurance across multiple domains
- **Documentation Coordinator**: Manages comprehensive documentation generation across deliverables

#### Domain Bridge Subagents
- **Integration Specialist**: Focuses on system integration points and data flow
- **Performance Specialist**: Focuses on performance optimization and resource efficiency
- **Security Specialist**: Focuses on security implications across all technical decisions
- **Compliance Specialist**: Focuses on regulatory and standards compliance

#### Meta-Process Subagents
- **Context Guardian**: Monitors and maintains context consistency across subagent workflows
- **Decision Tracker**: Maintains decision history and rationale across complex multi-agent workflows
- **Risk Monitor**: Continuously assesses emerging risks as work progresses
- **Quality Auditor**: Provides independent quality assessment of deliverables
